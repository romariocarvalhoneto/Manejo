It creates the network line from the network poles as points, 
creates the necessary layers for the evaluation, helps creating
the network surrounding area of influence as a buffer and also
the Preservation Areas - PA (APP in Portuguese) for springs and
rivers through buffers as well. The analysis considers the managing
area inside the network area of influence and the PA, giving a
report table with the managing areas inside the PA as well as the
areas outside the PA and inside the network area.
