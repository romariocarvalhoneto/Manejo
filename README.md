Managing Forest Areas Under The Power Lines Network

It creates the network line from the network poles as points, 
creates the necessary layers for the evaluation, helps creating
the network surrounding area of influence as a buffer and also
the Preservation Areas - PA (APP in Portuguese) for springs and
rivers through buffers as well. The analysis considers the managing
area inside the network area of influence and the PA, giving a
report table with the managing areas inside the PA as well as the
areas outside the PA and inside the network area.
